## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this plugin on the WordPress repo?

No.  It's meant to be more of a white-label plugin to use for your own client projects.

### What is `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` used for?

This is how translation file (`.pot`) are built. If you have Grunt installed and need to generate a new translation file, just run `npm install` and then `grunt`. If i18n is not needed for your project, feel free to remove.

### Can I use this on my own site?

Yes, go ahead. If you're also interested in having metaboxes, you may also want to look at [this project](https://github.com/devinsays/team-post-type).
